# Medical Appointment Booking Website

## Overview

This project is a frontend capstone application for a Medical Appointment Booking website. It provides users with an intuitive interface to search for available appointments, book slots with healthcare providers, and manage their schedules. The design emphasizes user experience, responsiveness, and accessibility, built using modern web technologies. The project follows a responsive layout suitable for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

The website includes key sections such as:
- **Landing Page**: Welcomes users and highlights key features.
- **Appointment Booking**: Allows users to select dates, times, and providers.
- **Login and Sign-Up**: Secure user authentication for personalized bookings.
- **Review System**: Users can leave feedback on appointments and providers.
- **Dashboard**: For viewing and managing booked appointments.

This starter code serves as the foundation for the frontend implementation, with placeholders for integration with backend services (e.g., API for booking data).

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Built with Figma prototypes and implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for cross-device compatibility.
- **Interactive Elements**: Clickable buttons for login, sign-up, and booking flows, prototyped in Figma using the Prototype tool.
- **Consistent Styling**: Global styles for colors, typography, and components (e.g., buttons, navbars) managed via Figma's Design System.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Commenting and annotation features in Figma for collaborative design reviews.
- **Custom Icons and Layouts**: Vector networks and Auto Layout in Figma for creating responsive sections like Appointment Booking.
- **Developer Handoff**: CSS code generated via Figma's Inspect feature for seamless frontend development.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Design Tool**: Figma (for prototyping, components, and handoff)
- **Build Tools**: (Add if applicable, e.g., Vite, Webpack for bundling)
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub for collaboration
- **Deployment**: (e.g., GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify for hosting the static site)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/grihf-frontend_capstone_starter_code.git
   cd grihf-frontend_capstone_starter_code
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies** (if using a build tool like npm):
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run Locally**:
   - For a static site: Open `index.html` in a web browser.
   - For development server (if using Vite or similar):
     ```
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Access the site at `http://localhost:5173` (or the specified port).

4. **Design in Figma**:
   - Open the Figma file (link: [Insert Figma file URL here]).
   - Use the Prototype tool to test interactive flows (e.g., sign-up process).
   - Ensure consistency with global styles for colors and typography.

## Usage

- **Booking an Appointment**: Navigate to the Appointment Booking section, select a provider, date, and time, then confirm.
- **Login/Sign-Up**: Use the interactive buttons prototyped in Figma to simulate authentication.
- **Review System**: After booking, users can submit feedback via the Review section.
- **Customization**: Modify layouts using Figma's Constraints and Auto Layout for responsiveness.

For development, use Figma's Inspect feature to generate CSS code for elements like buttons and navbars.
